# **n8n Notebook**

This repository contains the commands, prompts, patterns, and configuration notes for the various n8n automations I build and maintain.  
It is written with the assumption that you are using **n8n v1.119.1** or newer.

For installation and setup instructions, please refer to the official n8n documentation.

## **Design Philosophy**

> **AI automation should not be the one ring to rule them all.**  
> It should extend human capability - not replace it.

This notebook documents the thinking, guardrails, and reusable patterns behind my workflow design, rather than full exportable automations.
